    <h1>Refugee Civic Action Group</h1>
    <p>Empowering Refugee Participation</p>
  </header>

  <section id="about">
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>RCAG is a non-partisan organization committed to promoting civic engagement among refugees and new Americans in the U.S.</p>
  
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>Empower these communities through education, involvement, and leadership mentorship, fostering active citizenship.</p>
  
    <h2>Key Statistic</h2>
    <p>Over 3.6 million refugees/asylees in the U.S. are eligible to vote, yet they face significant barriers due to lack of education, lack of experience, and growing political hostility. Central PA has over 60 thousand eligible voters, and only 13 percent are registered to vote in the upcoming election.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Why Harrisburg, PA? -->
  <section id="why-harrisburg">
    <h2>Why Harrisburg, PA?</h2>
    <p>We are piloting our program in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, for two key reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Swing Voting State:</strong> Pennsylvania is a crucial swing state in national elections.</li>
      <li><strong>Refugee Population:</strong> Harrisburg is home to over 20,000 refugees, making it an ideal location for our pilot program.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Importance of the Project -->
  <section id="importance-project">
    <h2>Importance of the Project</h2>
    <p>Civic engagement is crucial for the integration and empowerment of refugees and new Americans. Participating in civic activities helps refugees feel more connected to their communities and fosters a sense of belonging. It also enables them to advocate for their needs and contribute to local and national decision-making processes. Despite its importance, many refugees face barriers to civic engagement, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lack of Knowledge:</strong> Many refugees are unaware of their civic rights and responsibilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Language Barriers:</strong> Limited proficiency in English can hinder refugees’ ability to understand and engage in civic processes.</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of Experience and Mentorship:</strong> Refugees often lack the experience and mentorship needed to navigate civic institutions and participate effectively in their communities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>According to recent data, only about 54% of naturalized citizens voted in the 2016 presidential election, compared to 62% of U.S.-born citizens​ (Pew Research Center)​​ (Bipartisan Policy Center)​. This gap highlights the need for targeted programs to increase civic participation among refugees.</p>

  <!-- Collaborative Efforts -->
  <section id="collaborative-efforts">
    <h2>Collaborative Efforts</h2>
    <p>RCAG’s approach is deeply collaborative, working closely with various stakeholders to ensure the success of our programs:</p>
    
    <h3>Religious Leaders</h3>
    <p>In the US, many refugees tend to engage with their ethnic-religious communities, including churches, mosques, Buddhist temples, and Hindu temples. These venues play a crucial role in helping refugees learn about local government and the significance of their involvement. RCAGs will collaborate with leaders from these religious institutions to engage refugees in their communities. This can involve recruiting religious leaders or hosting occasional activities, such as presentations, speeches, or cultural orientations, to connect with and support refugees.</p>
    
    <h3>College Campuses</h3>
    <p>Engage college students and faculty to volunteer and mentor refugee students.</p>
    
    <h3>Community Centers</h3>
    <p>Utilize local community centers as hubs for workshops, seminars, and community events. Partnership with organizations that are focused on integrating refugees into their new communities in the US and offering classes, seminars, and cultural orientation training in topics such as the importance of local legislative, local politics, etc.</p>
